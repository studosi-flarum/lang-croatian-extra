# Croatian language pack - extra

This contains some Croatian locales for Flarum extensions we're using on our forum. This is **not** a traditional extension.


# Installation

Execute `install.sh` in the root directory of this project.

You will be prompted to enter your Flarum root directory - enter it.

The script will just copy over the locale files if it finds the folder for them in your Flarum vendor folder.
